ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mtzfox

My programming is currently focused in learning **React**, **Vue**, **Node.js**, **UI libraries** and associated technology. 

More about what I'm doing online:
- My [Obsidian Publish site](https://obsidian.mikecarlson.io) is apart of a knowledge management project for learning and writing.
- I keep [Project Notes](https://obsidian.mikecarlson.io/Project+Notes) for updates to current personal projects.
- I have a [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@mtzfox/subscribe) for publishing articles.
- I use [Codesandbox] for testing and learning and add to Github.
- I spend time on Discord channels for Obsidian, [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/), and [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/).

[No more distractions!](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/). 
I try to avoid the major social media sites aimed at mining personal data and endless scrolling. The WORLD WIDE WEB is still out there and I want to be a part of making it exciting again.
