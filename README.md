ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mtzfox

My programming is currently focused in learning **React**, **Vue**, **Node.js**, **UI libraries** and associated technology. 

I'm obsessed with [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.mikecarlson.io) and [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/), spend a lot of time writing and studying new information.

My interest in technology and writing often involve me in different projects.
- My Obsidian [Project Notes](https://obsidian.mikecarlson.io/Project+Notes) has updates to current personal projects.
- My [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@mtzfox/subscribe) has published articles.
- I use [Codesandbox] for testing and learning.
- I spend time on Discord for Obsidian, [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/), and [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/).

[No more distractions](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/). I try to avoid the major social media sites that make us a product and normalize surveilance. I'm instead motivated towards a WORLD WIDE WEB which builds empathy and empowers us to learn.
