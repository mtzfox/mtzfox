- 👋 Hi, I’m @mtzfox
- 👀 I’m interested in ...learning everything I can. Just got into Vue Mastery. I am Obsidian Notes obsessed.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...React, Vue, Typescript mostly, and some Node.js. I'm also familiarizing myself with Vite and trying out more UI libraries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...whatever is doable and will take me to the next level of my ability. Getting paid is nice, too.
- 📫 How to reach me ...email or text. I hate voicemails.
